## Definitions

* **project** - all repository contents (code, media, documentation, etc.) distributed under this license;
* **original project** - the project in the version distributed by the current copyright holder(s);
* **copyright holder** - the person or persons specified in the LICENSE file or other official project documents who have legal property rights to the project (regardless of whether they are the authors or not);
* **changes** - any modifications to the project contents, regardless of who makes them;
* **official changes** - changes made by the copyright holder to the original project;

* **significant changes** - changes that collectively transform the project from a modification/patch into an independent commercially viable product. For objective assessment, the following criteria are taken into account:
* * **game content criterion**: meeting at least one of the following conditions is sufficient:
* * * adding new game levels, chapters, or story elements that substantially expand the gaming experience (20% or more of the original project's volume). This can be measured in the following ways:
* * * * increased game completion time (by 20% or more from the average completion time of the original project when tested by four different players under any conditions; deliberate distortion of results is a violation of the license);
* * * * increased number of game levels/locations (by 20% or more from the number in the original project);
* * * * increased volume of game text, dialogues, or quests (by 20% or more - measured in characters with spaces in the source files);
* * * * increased number of game missions/tasks (by 20% or more from the number in the original project);
* * * adding at least one new full-fledged game character with unique features and storyline. A full-fledged character is defined as:
* * * * a character with their own history, dialogues (at least 10 lines), and unique features;
* * * * a character playing a significant role in the gameplay or plot (influencing the development of the main storyline or having their own side storyline);
* * * * a character with unique game abilities, if applicable to the game genre;
* * * expanding the game world through adding new locations that did not exist in the original project (at least 2-3 full-fledged new locations with unique gameplay or plot significance);
* * * creating a new story branch or alternative ending (at least one full-fledged storyline different from the original, with a duration of at least 15% of the main plot);
* * **game mechanics criterion**: meeting at least one of the following conditions is sufficient:
* * * adding at least one new substantial game mechanic that significantly changes the gameplay and player interaction with the game (e.g., introducing a crafting system into a game without one, adding a new type of combat system, etc.);
* * * substantial changes to game balance that significantly alter the gaming experience (e.g., complete overhaul of the character progression system, changes to the game economy affecting more than 50% of game elements). Game elements include: character attributes, item parameters, game mechanics, progression systems, economic indicators, difficulty levels, and other customizable game components;
* * * adding new game modes (e.g., multiplayer to a single-player game or new single-player modes);
* * * redesigning the core control systems or interface that significantly changes the gaming experience (changing more than 30% of interface elements or primary control methods);
* * **new resources criterion**: meeting at least one of the following conditions is sufficient:
* * * creating and adding a significant volume of new original media resources (at least 20% of the volume of original resources by file size in bytes), which may include:
* * * * new textures, models, or animations;
* * * * new sound effects;
* * * * new musical compositions;
* * * redesigning the majority of the game's visual style (at least 30% of visual elements by number of files), while maintaining the core concept but offering a new visual experience;
* * * creating at least 5-7 new original musical compositions with a total duration of at least 15 minutes, significantly enriching the audio component of the game;
* * **accessibility criterion**: content hidden behind in-game purchases is not considered when determining the significance of changes;
* * **measurement notes**:
* * * when precise measurement by one method is not possible, it is recommended to use several evaluation methods and consider them collectively;
* * * disputed cases are reviewed by the copyright holder taking into account the overall impact of changes on the gaming experience;
* * * the modification author may provide their own arguments for compliance with the criteria with a detailed description of the changes;
* **community contribution** - any changes proposed by third parties through mechanisms such as pull requests that have been accepted and incorporated into the original project.

For informative purposes, it is recommended to accompany the modification with a README file containing a detailed description of changes made to the original project.

## 1. Authorship and Attribution

* you do not have the right to call yourself the author or creator of the original project;
* for any publication of a modification, you must specify:
* * the name of the original project (always required);
* * the name of the original project's copyright holder (required for modifications, but may not be indicated in certain cases according to sections [#1](/TERMS_OF_USE.md#1-использование-в-медиа-и-прямых-трансляциях) and [#2](/TERMS_OF_USE.md#2-использование-медиаресурсов) of the [Terms of Use](/TERMS_OF_USE.md);
* * a link to the source repository;
* * explicit indication that your project is based on the original project;
* attribution must be clearly visible to users and can be placed in one or more of the following ways:
* * in the source code (in the README file, in the ATTRIBUTION file, or in file or scene headers in the source file as comments);
* * in the application itself (in one of the game screens, which may include the game information menu, splash screen, or credits);
* * in the project description on all distribution platforms;
* * for public server services - in the service description, documentation, or "About" section;
* * for closed corporate environments - in internal documentation;
* publication and distribution (but not creation) of forks (modifications) where the only significant change is adding yourself to the list of authors within the project is prohibited. This restriction does not apply to automatically generated information (commit history, names of edit authors) or technical metadata added by the version control platform.

> **Note**: examples of proper attribution can be found in the document ["Attribution Examples"](/ATTRIBUTION.md).

## 2. Source Code Use

* you have the right to download, view, and modify the project's source code;
* you may document the source code (e.g., create documentation or articles on wiki resources);
* republication of the source code on other resources is allowed only with mandatory indication of the original project name, copyright holder name, and link to the original source;
* you have the right to distribute compiled executable files (builds) without providing the source code of your modification to the general public (closed source code is permitted), but the original project's copyright holder has the right to request the source code when suspecting a violation of the license terms for compliance verification. Suspicion of violation includes, for example, discovery of hidden or fictitious attribution, when attribution is shown to the copyright holder but hidden from ordinary users. In this case:
* * the modification author is obligated to provide the source code only to the copyright holder and only for verification within 30 calendar days of receiving the request;
* * the copyright holder agrees not to distribute the provided code;
* use of the source code for educational purposes, including in paid training courses, is permitted, provided the attribution rules are followed. Such use does not require additional permission from the copyright holder.

## 3. Commercial Use

* commercial use of the project is divided into the following categories:
* * **direct commercialization**: selling the modification itself, the build, or access to it for a fixed price;
* * **indirect commercialization**: generating revenue from advertising, donations, or related products/services;
* * **built-in paid elements**: monetization through in-game purchases or paid content (premium content), including free-to-play models with microtransactions;
* for direct commercialization, one of the following conditions is necessary:
* * presence of significant changes according to the criteria in the [Definitions section](#definitions) (in this case, no special permission from the copyright holder is required);
* * written permission from the copyright holder;
* for indirect commercialization, only compliance with attribution rules is required;
* for built-in paid elements in free modifications, only compliance with attribution rules is required;
* **category distinction**: if the main modification is distributed for free but contains paid add-ons or paid content (premium content), this is considered "built-in paid elements," not direct commercialization;
* for commercial publication, the modification author must describe in detail the significant changes made in the accompanying materials and at the place of publication;
* *recommendation (not an obligation)*: authors of commercial modifications are encouraged to offer their users the opportunity to financially support the original project's copyright holder, for example, by placing a link to relevant resources.

## 4. Modifications and Forks

* you can download, modify, share, and publish modifications and their builds while following attribution rules;
* a modification author can create and maintain a fork from the official source code repository;
* you can create and maintain forks from repositories of other modifications if their license allows it;
* a modification must not be created to circumvent internal project restrictions for fraudulent purposes;
* the build name must not match the name of the official source code build;
* the modification/fork/fan game/tool must use a separate path for storing saves to avoid affecting the original project's data, except when:
* * changing the original project's saves is one of the intentional purposes (e.g., a save editor tool);
* * the modification's name or description explicitly indicates that it modifies the main game's saves;
* modifications must be clearly distinguishable from the original project:
* * the modification name must not mislead regarding its connection to the original project;
* * the modification description must explicitly state that it is a modification, not the original project;
* modification authors have the right to retain the logo and trademarks of the original project in their modification, provided they follow attribution rules and do not mislead regarding authorship or official status of the modification.

## 5. Distribution

* publication of builds is permitted in commercial digital stores (Google Play, Steam, Epic Games Store, etc.) only if there are significant changes or written permission from the copyright holder;
* recommended platforms for publishing non-commercial modifications: ModDB, GameBanana, Game Jolt, itch.io, Newgrounds, GitHub;
* the publication page of a modification or build must indicate the original project's author and a link to the source;
* the modification must preserve copyright notices in the source files;
* distribution of builds under DRM mechanisms, proprietary licenses, or with restrictions that prevent compliance with mandatory attribution is permitted only with written permission from the copyright holder. Otherwise, builds must preserve or provide access to authorship information and a link to the original project at first launch or in the documentation. *Recommendation*: when using DRM protection, it is strongly recommended to duplicate attribution in the product description on distribution platforms (Steam, Epic Games Store, and others).

## 6. Community Contributions and Use of Ideas

* making a contribution does not give the right to be considered a co-author of the original project as a whole, unless explicitly stated by the copyright holder;
* the original project's copyright holder has the right to use ideas, gameplay mechanics, concepts, and other elements from any modifications of their project for inclusion in the original project without limitations. In doing so:
* * the copyright holder agrees to indicate the authorship of ideas if they were borrowed from modifications, in changelogs or other documentation of the original project;
* * such indication of idea authorship is an acknowledgment of contribution but does not give the idea's author property rights to the original project;
* * this right cannot be limited by modification authors choosing a different license for their projects;
* this right to use ideas does not extend to specific code or media resources created by modification authors, unless they have been provided to the copyright holder or published under a compatible license.

The remaining part is set out in the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). By providing a contribution, you agree to the terms of this license and acknowledge the copyright holder's right to use your ideas in the original project.
